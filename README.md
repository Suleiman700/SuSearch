It is worth to mention that SuSearch uses callbacks to handle actions.

Callbacks are important in each project, It handles user actions and send it to a callback function to handle it.

Each time you type/search SuSearch will handle these data and send it to a callback you set.

You'd ask your self "What Is Fuzzy Search ?"

Well the answer for that is simple, A fuzzy search is a technique to search in data item by item to get the best matching results.


Examples:
* Search by phone number in a large data of numbers and phone number should be active = true.
* Search for customers that their name ends with "smith" and age bigger than 37.
* Search in products by product barcode and the product price should be less than $1,000.
