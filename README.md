Well the answer for that is simple, A fuzzy search is a technique to search in data item by item to get the best matching results.


Examples:
* Search by phone number in a large data of numbers and phone number should be active = true.
* Search for customers that their name ends with "smith" and age bigger than 37.
* Search in products by product barcode and the product price should be less than $1,000.
